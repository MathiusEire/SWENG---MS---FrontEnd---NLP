Title: Labour plans maternity pay rise

Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children
"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament." She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid
Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: "While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected." She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.
Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers
