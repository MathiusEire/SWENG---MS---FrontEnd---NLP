Title: Hodgson shoulders England blame

"I'm very disappointed with the result and with my myself," Hodgson said
The lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half, they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn't build on it
England went in at half-time with a 17-6 lead but they failed to score in the second half and Dimitri Yachvili slotted over four penalties as France overhauled the deficit
"We controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time," he said
